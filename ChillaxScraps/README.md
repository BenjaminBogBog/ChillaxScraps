# NEWS
After a long period I have finally found time to update this mod, I've fixed the mods to be compatible with newer patch versions and the biggest change in the latest update is I have changed the Uno Reverse Card behaviour a little along with some bug fixes. Also I've been seeing clips of you guys using this mod on Tik Tok and Youtube and it's great to see you creating these awesome funny moments, thank you so much for playing guys <3 Also really excited to move the Death Note from Testing to Finished Scrap :D

## Finished Scraps
- Boink
- Eevee Plush
- Froggy Chair
- Cup Noodle : Heals you and gives you stamina when eaten
- (**NEW**) Death Note : Writing a player's name in the book will kill them instantly.
- Moai
- Freddy FazBear?

## Scraps in testing
- Nokia 3310
- (**NEW**) Uno Reverse Card : Comes in 2 colors; Red: Swaps position of the user with a random available monster (otherwise it will choose a random players if none have spawned); and Blue: Swaps position of the user with a random player.

## UPCOMING
- A smartphones? (Video call with your friends haha let me know what you think in the discord).
- Death Note where instead of killing the target player instantly, the little girl spawns instead to haunt the targeted player.
